# Machine Learning Algorithm Code

* Neural Network
    * ANN
    * RNN
    * LSTM
* Cluster
    * DBSCAN
* Basic
    * Logistic Regression
* Text Mining
    * LDA

## Explanation
* The reason why I create this project is to collect the core machine learning source code for convenience of building model.
* All these code except NN could put in your real production environment and easily to handle with.
* I also provided simple data to each model so that you could use these model quickly.
* Neural Network in this package are minimal,clean examples without using any framework.They were made for learning purposes.
